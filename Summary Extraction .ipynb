      "text of the article =  Brady looked unsteady for much of the game, overthrowing receivers and settling for field goals instead of touchdowns. Still, when he completed a 28-yard pass to receiver Mike Evans in the first quarter, Brady became the N.F.L.’s career passing leader, surpassing the record of 80,358 yards set last year by Drew Brees, the New Orleans Saints quarterback who retired at the end of the season. Brady now has 80,560 passing yards. He also has the most touchdown passes in N.F.L. history, with 591, having thrown 20 more than Brees.\n",
      "\n",
      "New England noted the passing yards record on the stadium’s video screens and there was a burst of cheers, but it was otherwise business as usual as fans snapped back into form.\n",
      "\n",
      "They roared when Patriots linebacker Matt Judon sacked Brady for an 8-yard loss in the second quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brady, though, did what he’s done so many times: He came alive when the stakes were high. Down by 7-3 with less than two minutes left in the first half, Brady quickly completed four passes for 69 yards to put the Buccaneers in a position to score. Then he missed three straight passes and the team settled for a field goal to narrow the deficit to 7-6 at halftime.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brady and the Buccaneers found their footing late in the third quarter when they used their running game to march 52 yards down the field and score their first touchdown to regain the lead, 13-7. After the Patriots scored their second touchdown, Brady leaned heavily on running back Leonard Fournette, who finished with 91 yards rushing. Brady even ran for 6 yards and a first down, extending a drive that ended with Ryan Succop’s kicking the third of his four field goals to help the Buccaneers regain the lead, 16-14.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jones overcame poor pass protection and no running game to keep the Patriots in the game. He completed 31 of 40 passes, including 19 completions in a row at one point, for 275 yards, two touchdowns and one interception. The Patriots’ offensive coordinator, Josh McDaniels, also called two trick plays, including one in which receiver Jakobi Meyers threw to receiver Nelson Agholor for a 30-yard gain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many of Jones’s passes went to receivers being defended by Richard Sherman, the All-Pro cornerback who was signed last week as a free agent by the Buccaneers. Sherman, who sat out most of 2020 with an injury, was called for pass interference late in the game.\n",

      "WASHINGTON — A transformed Supreme Court returns to the bench on Monday to start a momentous term in which it will consider eliminating the constitutional right to abortion, vastly expanding gun rights and further chipping away at the wall separating church and state.\n",
      "The abortion case, a challenge to a Mississippi law that bars most abortions after 15 weeks, has attracted the most attention.\n",
      "The highly charged docket will test the leadership of Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., who lost his position at the court’s ideological center with the arrival last fall of Justice Amy Coney Barrett.\n",
      "He is now outflanked by five justices to his right, limiting his ability to guide the court toward the consensus and incrementalism he has said he prefers.\n",
      "The chief justice, who views himself as the custodian of the court’s institutional authority, now leads a court increasingly associated with partisanship and that recent polls show is suffering a distinct drop in public support.\n",

      "He also fell in love with American rock music, playing guitar in a band that performed at his high school graduation.\n",
      "In an interview with The New York Times in June, during his first visit to France as secretary of state, Mr. Blinken called his time in Paris “a life-changing experience” that allowed him “to be able to see my own country from a different perspective.\n",
      "And that was a very powerful thing.”Mr. Blinken left France in 1980 to attend Harvard University and Columbia Law School, then returned for two years to work at a law firm in Paris.\n",

      "The claims against King Abdullah were part of a major investigation, known as the Pandora Papers, that was conducted by the ICIJ in partnership with more than a dozen international news outlets, including The Washington Post and The Guardian.\n",
      "Based on leaks of nearly 12 million files from 14 offshore companies, the investigation found that King Abdullah was among 35 current and former leaders, as well as more than 300 public officials, who have used offshore shell companies to disguise their wealth, and to hide the transfer of that wealth overseas.\n",

      "though quite straightforward this recipe for norwegian apple cake from nevada bergs cookbook north wild kitchen did raise a question but it was not at all excessive giving the cake autumnal fragrance and flavor along with a nicely burnished surface what this recipe also offers is great flexibility though it calls for an 8inch springform it also worked in a 9inch and a 10inch the latter providing a little less cake in proportion to topping though no change in cooking time and on that score in place of apples the recipe works well with fresh figs and peaches\n",
